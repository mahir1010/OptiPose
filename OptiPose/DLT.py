Camera calibration and point reconstruction based on direct linear transformation (DLT).

The fundamental problem here is to find a mathematical relationship between the 
 coordinates  of a 3D point and its projection onto the image plane. The DLT 
 (a linear apporximation to this problem) is derived from modelling the object 
 and its projection on the image plane as a pinhole camera situation.
In simplistic terms, using the pinhole camera model, it can be found by similar 
 triangles the following relation between the image coordinates (u,v) and the 3D 
 point (X,Y,Z):
   [ u ]   [ L1  L2  L3  L4 ] [ X ]
   [ v ] = [ L5  L6  L7  L8 ] [ Y ]
   [ 1 ]   [ L9 L10 L11 L12 ] [ Z ]
                              [ 1 ]
The matrix L is kwnown as the camera matrix or camera projection matrix. For a 
 2D point (X,Y), the last column of the matrix doesn't exist. In fact, the L12 
 term (or L9 for 2D DLT) is not independent from the other parameters and then 
 there are only 11 (or 8 for 2D DLT) independent parameters in the DLT to be 
 determined.

DLT is typically used in two steps: 1. camera calibration and 2. object (point) 
 reconstruction.
The camera calibration step consists in digitizing points with known coordiantes 
 in the real space.
At least 4 points are necessary for the calibration of a plane (2D DLT) and at 
 least 6 points for the calibration of a volume (3D DLT). For the 2D DLT, at least
 one view of the object (points) must be entered. For the 3D DLT, at least 2 
 different views of the object (points) must be entered.
These coordinates (from the object and image(s)) are inputed to the DLTcalib 
 algorithm which  estimates the camera parameters (8 for 2D DLT and 11 for 3D DLT).
With these camera parameters and with the camera(s) at the same position of the 
 calibration step,  we now can reconstruct the real position of any point inside 
 the calibrated space (area for 2D DLT and volume for the 3D DLT) from the point 
 position(s) viewed by the same fixed camera(s). 

This code can perform 2D or 3D DLT with any number of views (views).
For 3D DLT, at least two views (views) are necessary.

There are more accurate (but more complex) algorithms for camera calibration that
 also consider lens distortion. For example, OpenCV and Tsai softwares have been
 ported to Python. However, DLT is classic, simple, and effective (fast) for 
 most applications.

About DLT, see: http://kwon3d.com/theory/dlt/dlt.html

This code is based on different implementations and teaching material on DLT 
 found in the internet.
